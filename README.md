# tictactoAI
This is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. As an opponent, you can choose another player, a bot that makes random moves, a more advanced random bot that tries to prevent you from winning or aims to win itself, or a Minimax AI bot. The Minimax AI evaluates possible moves and ranks them based on a scoring system to determine the best next move.
The game can be started using engine.py. Currently, opponent selection is only possible by modifying the input parameter of the make_move_wrapper method, also located in engine.py.
Moves should be entered in the format 00 or 0 0.
